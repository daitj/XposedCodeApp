## This project is no longer maintained, I use systemless root using Magisk to hide root status from different apps, only works for Android 5.0+ for older Android phones use [NordeaRootBypasser](https://github.com/Razer2015/NordeaRootBypasser).

# XposedCodeApp
Removes root restriction from a Finnish bank's (you know which) mobile code app.

This is Android Studio Project and XposedBridgeApi 80 is used but works with older version also upto.
You can change the config from AndroidManifest.xml.
